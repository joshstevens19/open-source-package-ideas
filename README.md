# Open source package ideas

If you are looking to help or be part of the open source community or can not find a package which does what you want, you have come to the right place. 
This repo was purely created to help us all come together in one place to power the open source community to grow even more.

Please watch the repo for notifications of new open source package ideas.

## Inspiration for the repo

I love making open source packages but sometimes struggle for ideas which are useful. I thought something like this benefits everyone from people who want to code and make cool stuff, to new programmers we are struggling to solve a issue, to developers who want to find their first package to work on, to developers who want to find other developers they can build stuff with and maybe make some great connections along the way.   

## Suggesting new package ideas
This repo is open to all programming languages please just write the language you want the package to be in within your issue template. 

### How to suggest a package idea
1) Open a new issue [here](https://github.com/joshstevens19/open-source-package-ideas/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=open-source-package-request.md&title=)
2) Fill out the issue template with as much detail as you can

Thatâ€™s it. People will comment to ask questions, and someone will take this package on. If that is a group of people or just one. 
Please note this is not a place to post code fixes it is not a stack overflow this is a place to discuss and create new amazing open source packages.

## Taking part in the new package ideas
If you see something you like in the issue threads, then please comment and let people know you want to start working on this package. If there are a few of you interested, you can use this thread to sync and share a public repo which you can all work on. 
Once the package is finished and published please link the new package in the thread and we will close it. 

## Commenting on package ideas
Everyone who posts an open source package idea is coming from a good place so please treat everyone with respect. If the idea is something you do not think is useful just move on we do not want any negativity on issue threads, this is only to bring a positive impact to the open source community. 

## Support

For this to be as successful as we all want please star the repo and also share it with any people you know who would be interested in this. I think we can have a big impact and grow the open source community even more.

Happy coding guys!
